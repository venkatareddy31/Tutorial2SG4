				Project Idea and relevance to Lab2
Brandon and Jeff did lab 2 on Twitter API which sends the text messages to twitter in real time. 
This will be useful in our project to send the results from the robot to the twitter.

We (SG4) done text to speech conversion using google talk API. 
This will be useful to communicate with Robot and the Robot will be voicing the output. 
Our project is on security monitoring and any security breach in house and the robot will tell you and alert us. 
We might improve our ideas in future work.
